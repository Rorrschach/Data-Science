The number of instances are not large enough to make a significant difference in the results

Q2.3) The most powerful attribute is the show_size attribute as every single female has a shoe size less than 40 and every male had larger than 40 except 1. Another important attribute is weight, as no female has weight over 70kg and only 16 males have weight under 70kg

Q2.4) After removing the abovementioned columns the accuracy of the model has lowered slightly
